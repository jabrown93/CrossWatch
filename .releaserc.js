// Versioning is automated from Conventional Commits:
//   * push to `main` -> stable release (feat -> minor, fix/perf -> patch, ! -> major)
//   * push to `beta` -> prerelease (vX.Y.Z-beta.N)
//
// Routine runtime dependency bumps (fix(deps), from Renovate via the shared
// preset) intentionally do NOT cut a release on ordinary pushes -- fix would
// otherwise trigger a patch via the default rules, so it is explicitly
// suppressed here. The weekly scheduled run in .github/workflows/release.yml
// sets RELEASE_DEPS=true, which promotes the accumulated bumps into one patch
// release. Vulnerability fixes are typed fix(security) by the preset, not
// fix(deps), so they are unaffected by the suppression and still release
// immediately. See jabrown93/.github's README, "Weekly dependency releases".
//
// This file is CommonJS (there is no root package.json with "type": "module");
// semantic-release loads it via cosmiconfig.
